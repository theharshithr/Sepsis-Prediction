# Sepsis-Prediction

Sepsis, a perilous condition wherein an immune system tends to overreact to an infection, remains a topic of intense investigation within the scientific community due to its complexity and diverse manifestations.
Sepsis is caused when the bodyâ€™s immune system becomes overactive in response to an infection, causing inflammation which can affect how well other tissues and organs work.

Sepsis is categorized into three distinct stages: sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.
